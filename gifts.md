I (Eliza) am going to be honest here.  I love gifts. Love them. However, Keith and I are buying a home built in 1930 that is a "fixer-upper" that really needs some love.  We'll be modernizing the kitchen, replacing ancient old sash windows and all kinds of other soon-to-be-discovered projects.

So, if you're in the giving mood, we'd much prefer that you help us with outfitting the house (or the honeymoon!) through our Honeyfund registry.

Regardless, and this is the important part, your presence is the best gift you can give us.  This is a very special time in our lives and having our friends and family there to support us means a lot.

### Honeyfund

Honeyfund is, essentially, a cash registry.  Through Honeyfund, you can help us with our goals of fixing up our new house or contribute to our honeymoon fund.

Since we're in the midst of buying a house (closing Aug. 15), this is the best present you can get us!

### Amazon & Macy's

We have also prepared registries at Amazon and Macy's with household goods that we'd quite enjoy.
