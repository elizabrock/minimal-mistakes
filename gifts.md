I (Eliza) am going to be honest here.  I love gifts. Love them. However, Keith and I have been living on our own for a while now, and we really just don't need very many things.

So, if you're in the giving mood, we'd much prefer that you help us with outfitting the house (or the honeymoon!) through our Honeyfund registry.

Regardless, and this is the important part, your presence is the best gift you can give us.  This is a very special time in our lives and having our friends and family there to support us means a lot.

### Honeyfund

Honeyfund is, essentially, a cash registry.  Through Honeyfund, you can help us with our goals of fixing up our new house or contribute to our honeymoon fund.

Since we're in the midst of buying a house (closing Aug. 15), this is the best present you can get us!

### Amazon

We have also prepared a small Amazon registry of household goods that we'd quite enjoy.
