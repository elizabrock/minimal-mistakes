## Overview

We will be marrying in the backyard of our good friend, Rick Bradley, who has kindly offered to host our wedding as part of his annual party.

The wedding will be at 5:30, followed by a quick family-and-friends reception. At 7:00, we will be joined by more friends, as part of Rick's annual party!

Food, drinks, and cake will all be served!

You have the option to stay as late as you like, or to head home once the private part of the evening concludes (7PM).

## Venue / Location

The house is located at 5001 Indiana Ave., Nashville, TN 37209.

We will be holding both the wedding and the reception in the backyard.

You can park at the church next door, or on the street.  Please note that the wedding is occurring in Rick's backyard (not at the church!).

### Ceremony 5:30 PM CDT

We will have a small ceremony, officiated by a friend.

Hopefully there will be some nice music and heartfelt words.

### Reception 6:00 PM CDT

Our reception will also be hosted in the backyard.

We will start with Champagne & Cake because.. no need to save the best for last.

### After-party 7:00 PM CDT

This portion of the evening is open to the public, so more of our friends and acquaintances will be joining us at this point!

After 7, there will be plenty of people showing up that may or may not know Keith and Eliza well.  It will be a general fun time for all, rather than a formal event.

There will be food (with vegetarian options), homebrewed beer and so on!

There is usually impromptu live music, great conversation and lovely weather.

### Weather

The weather should be nice.  However, we will have a tent available should it rain.

[Weather Spark](http://weatherspark.com/averages/29787/10/5/Nashville-Tennessee-United-States) has more information on the average weather in October.

### Attire

It would be nice if you dress up a little (i.e. a collared shirt or a weather-appropriate dress instead of a T-shirt) but this is *not* a formal event.

Please dress comfortably.  We will be outside for most of the evening and it will get a little chilly after dark.

You'll be walking around on a lawn, so stilletos are probably not a wise choice.

The bride will be wearing a full-length off-the-shoulder dress.  The groom will be wearing a suit.
