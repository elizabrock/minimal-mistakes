## Overview

We will be marrying in the backyard of our good friend, Rick Bradley.

The wedding will be at 5:30, followed by a quick family-and-friends reception. At 7:00, we will be joined by more friends as well as the attendees of the Ruby Hoedown conference.

Food, drinks, and cake will all be served!

You have the option to stay as late as you like, or to head home once the private part of the evening concludes (7PM).

## Venue

The house is located at 5001 Indiana Ave., Nashville, TN 37209.

We will be holding both the wedding and the reception in the backyard.

### Ceremony 5:30 PM

We will have a small ceremony, officiated by a friend.

Hopefully there will be some nice music and heartfelt words.

### Reception 6:00 PM

Our reception will also be hosted in the backyard.

We will start with Champagne & Cake because.. no need to save the best for last.

We will be serving food and drink, however none of that has been determined yet.  Please let us know if you have special dietary needs.

### After-party 7:00 PM

The [Ruby Hoedown](http://rubyhoedown.com/) after-party will be occuring in conjunction with our reception.

The Ruby Hoedown is a two-day professional conference.  As many of our friends are in town for the Hoedown and will be attending the Hoedown after-party anyway, combining the two events is a perfect way to see everyone and have fun!

After 7, there will be plenty of people showing up that may or may not know Keith and Eliza well.  It will be a general fun time for all, rather than a formal event.

There is usually impromptu live music, great conversation and lovely weather.

### Weather

The weather should be nice.  However, we will have a tent available should it rain.

[Weather Spark](http://weatherspark.com/averages/29787/10/5/Nashville-Tennessee-United-States) has more information on the average weather in October.

### Attire

It would be nice if you dress up a little (i.e. a collared shirt or a weather-appropriate dress instead of a T-shirt) but this is *not* a formal event.

Please dress comfortably.  We will be outside for most of the evening and it will get a little chilly after dark.

You'll be walking around on a lawn, so stilletos are probably not a wise choice.

The bride will be wearing a full-length sleeveless dress.  The groom will be wearing a suit.
