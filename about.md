## Together

Keith and Eliza met in 2005 when they ended up living in <a href="http://www.rose-hulman.edu/about/facilities/student-life-housing/percopo-hall.aspx">neighboring dormitory suites</a>.

They now live in Nashville, TN and are in the process of buying their first home and, of course, getting married!

## Getting Married!

Keith proposed on June 28th, 2013, on the last day of the class Eliza teaches at Nashville Software School.

The wedding was originally (tentatively) planned for Spring 2014.  However, Rick Bradley kindly offered to combine the wedding with a party that was already planned for October 5th, 2013.  As many of the couple's friends were already planning to attend the party, this is the perfect opportunity to have a relaxed and affordable wedding with friends and family.
