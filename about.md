## Together

Keith and Eliza met in 2005 when they ended up living in <a href="http://www.rose-hulman.edu/about/facilities/student-life-housing/percopo-hall.aspx">neighboring dormitory suites</a>.

They now live in Nashville, TN and are in the process of buying their first home and, of course, getting married!
